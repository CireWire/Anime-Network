I'm still learning to use AngularJS and I hope to soon incorporate it with Meteor, but until then I'm still sorting things out. I hope you can check it out and feel free to clone it for whatever reason you want!\r\n\r\n### Follow the process\r\nI'm using Trello to keep things sorted while I work on the repo. \r\nhttps://trello.com/b/hspKMTyu\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@CireWire and all sourced contributors to the HTML5 and Bootstrap codes.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYou can send a message if you have any questions. \r\nFollow me on Twitter! www.twitter.com/CireWire\r\n",
